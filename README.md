XB1 SYNTH
==============================

This is a program that lets you control a synthesizer with an XBox One controller.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.6 x86
- pyo (http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/)
- pygame
- python-osc

Instructions:
- Start by connecting your XB1 controller with a usb cable
- Launch controller_server.py
- Launch controller_client.py
- Set up your IO
- Have fun!

Note: As you press buttons, stuff will get printed in the command line telling you what each button does. You can of course read the manual in case you want more details on the synth and the mapping of the buttons.
